# Outlier Detection and Analysis for Air Quality in Mexico City

This analysis explores outlier detection methods for air quality data in Mexico City, focusing on key pollutants: **O3 (ozone), PM2.5, and PM10.** The project includes:

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identification of seasonal trends, weather influences, and pollutant spikes.

**2. Outlier Detection:** Application of methods including Interquartile Range (IQR), Isolation Forest, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to identify anomalies.

**3. Insights and Recommendations:** Summarized findings, highlighting the most effective method (Isolation Forest) for anomaly detection and linking results to health and policy recommendations.

**4. Alignment with Literature:** Discussion of findings in the context of known air pollution impacts, seasonal effects, and policy guidelines.
